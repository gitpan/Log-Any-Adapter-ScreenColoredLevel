NAME

    colorized messages according to level

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::Any::Adapter;
     Log::Any::Adapter->set('ScreenColoredLevel',
         # min_level => 'debug', # default is 'warning'
         # colors    => { trace => 'bold yellow on_gray', ... }, # customize colors
         # use_color => 1, # force color even when not interactive
         # stderr    => 0, # print to STDOUT instead of STDERR
     );

DESCRIPTION
    This Log::Any adapter prints log messages to screen (STDERR/STDOUT)
    colored according to level. It is just like
    Log::Log4perl::Appender::ScreenColoredLevel, even down to the default
    colors, except that you don't have to use Log::Log4perl.

    Parameters:

    *   min_level => STRING

        Set logging level. Default is warning. If LOG_LEVEL environment
        variable is set, it will be used instead. If TRACE environment
        variable is set to true, level will be set to 'trace'. If DEBUG
        environment variable is set to true, level will be set to 'debug'.
        If VERBOSE environment variable is set to true, level will be set to
        'info'.If QUIET environment variable is set to true, level will be
        set to 'error'.

    *   use_color => BOOL

        Whether to use color or not. Default is true only when running
        interactively (-t STDOUT returns true).

    *   colors => HASH

        Customize colors. Hash keys are the logging methods, hash values are
        colors supported by Term::ANSIColor.

        The default colors are:

         method/level                 color
         ------------                 -----
         trace                        yellow
         debug                        (none, terminal default)
         info, notice                 green
         warning                      blue
         error                        magenta
         critical, alert, emergency   red

    *   stderr => BOOL

        Whether to print to STDERR, default is true. If set to 0, will print
        to STDOUT instead.
